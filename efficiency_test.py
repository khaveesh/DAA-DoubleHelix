""" Generates test cases to check the efficiency of respective 
    algorithms and then analyse them
    
    List Format
        - Since number of terms in the list is a determining factor, 
          we are going to keep varying the size of list from 1 to 10000
        - Since we are calculating Big-O we must make sure that Union of
          list 1 and list 2 is a null set
        - A total of 2*10‚Åµ values lists will be generated
    
    List Input
        Input
            - list 1 will begin from 0 and go till 9999
            - list 2 will begin from -10000 and go till -1
